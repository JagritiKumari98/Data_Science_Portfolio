## <span style="color:#2c3e50;">**Project Overview**</span>
This project aims to analyze user engagement patterns for a mobile app. By studying metrics such as session durations, retention rates, and feature usage, we can gain insights into user behavior and identify areas for improvement to enhance user engagement.

## <span style="color:#e74c3c;">**Key Insights**</span>
- <span style="color:#8e44ad;">**Session Durations**</span>: Analyzed average and peak session lengths to understand how long users stay engaged.
- <span style="color:#3498db;">**Retention Rates**</span>: Conducted cohort analysis to see how many users return to the app over different time intervals (e.g., 1-day, 7-day, 30-day retention).
- <span style="color:#f39c12;">**Popular Features**</span>: Identified the most-used app features, showing which parts of the app engage users the most.

To explore the analysis, open the `.ipynb` file titled `User Engagement Analysis.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook viewer (such as [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or by running Jupyter Notebook on your local machine). The notebook contains all code, visualizations, and detailed explanations of each analysis step.
